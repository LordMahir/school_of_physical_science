      <hr>
      <p>
			IIT Mandi offers this program that allows students admitted as part of the M.Sc. program to upgrade to a dual-degree 
			PG+Ph.D. program.
			</p><br>
      <p class="h5" style="color:blue;">Selection Process</p>
      <hr>
      <p>
			Interested M.Sc. students who have completed all the core courses of the respective M.Sc. program with a minimum 8.0 CGPA
			within the first three semesters at IIT Mandi can apply for upgradation to the M.Sc.+Ph.D. program based on an internal 
			call made by the PG admissions committee or any other designated committee of the respective school. The committee may 
			prescribe higher shortlisting criteria as per the number of requests and need and would interview the shortlisted 
			candidates in their broad area of interest. 
			</p><br>
      <p class="h5" style="color:blue;">Program Structure</p>
      <hr>
      <p>
			Students can directly start working on a problem from his/her first semester of their Ph.D. after successful completion 
			of M.Sc. requirements. It will save time in doing a Ph.D. as there will be no re-application, courses, and/or PG thesis 
			waived off.
			</p><br>  
			<p class="h5" style="color:blue;">Syllabus</p>
      <hr>
      <p>
			Same as for M.Sc. for first two years and after upgradation no compulsory course work is required.
