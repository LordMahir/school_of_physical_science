		Nestled in the Sivalik Range of the Himalayas, away from the bustle of the metropolis,  a new abode of learning has germinated. A few hours before the Himalayan resort Kullu in Himachal Pradesh, IIT Mandi has been established with the vision to be a leader in science and technology education, knowledge creation, and innovation, in India marching towards a just, inclusive and sustainable society. 
		Our institute is situated on the lap of nature over the lush green mountains covered with Pine trees and varieties of flora and fauna. River Uhl & tributary of river Beas flows along the South & North campus respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
		Both campuses are bestowed with an excellent panoramic view of the Himalayas, rivers, flora, and fauna with a peaceful atmosphere surrounded by greenery and the pleasant sound of the river. The campus is far away from the city hustle & bustle which provides an ideal place for young and innovative minds to carry on their studies and research works.
		</p>
		<p>
		The South campus is situated near village Kamand & North campus is near village Salgi in Mandi tehsil of district Mandi of Himachal Pradesh. The campus is connected to Mandi town through a well-maintained road. The campus is approximately 18 km. from Mandi town.
